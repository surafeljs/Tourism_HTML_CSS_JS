        <h1>About Ethiopia</h1>
        <p>
          Ethiopia is a captivating destination that offers a unique blend of
          ancient history, breathtaking landscapes, and rich cultural diversity.
          Often referred to as the “Cradle of Humanity,” Ethiopia promises an
          unforgettable experience in 2025. This landlocked country, located in
          the Horn of Africa, boasts a history that spans over 3,000 years,
          making it one of the oldest nations in the world. It was never fully
          colonized, standing as a symbol of African independence, particularly
          after its victory in the Battle of Adwa in 1896. The country’s
          capital, Addis Ababa, is not only the political and diplomatic hub of
